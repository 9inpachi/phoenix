WebEventDisplay
===============

Visualises JSON event and geometry data using [three.js](http://threejs.org)

To install, you need to clone this repository, but also copy any missing files from [here](http://emoyse.web.cern.ch/emoyse/WebEventDisplay/js/) and put them in your local js directory.
It should then be enough to open `jsdisplay.html` in a web browser.

The JSON format is pretty simple, and soon I'll actually document it! For the moment, have a look at the `.json` files in http://emoyse.web.cern.ch/emoyse/WebEventDisplay

This is still very much a work in progress, so let me know of any problems (but don't be too surprised if there are some).
