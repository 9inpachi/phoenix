# Contributing

## 1. Issue tracking

The best way to start contributing is to explore the GitHub issue tracker for the repository. 

If you have already tried the application feel free to open an issue if you notice any bug or feature that could be improved.

Include a brief description and context of the issue, and optionally choose labels to mark the issue as `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`...
to give extra information to other developers.

## 2. Start coding
Once you are decided to start contributing on the repository, 
you may want to take a look at our developer guide that can be found [here](./src/assets/docs/developers.md).


## 3. Pull Requests

When creating a `Pull Request` please include a short description explaining what has changed and why. 
This will help others reviewing your code so you may also reference any issues that you were working on fixing.

Finally choose a meaningful title so your pull request can be easily identified.


## Thanks!
